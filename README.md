Towards Linking Linguistic Resources in the Humanities

* Existing digitisation and markup initiatives
    * focus on reproducing the digital archive
    * Some form the basis for api access and app development
* DH Standards & Knowledge bases

* Collection of Language Resources
    * Resources from publicly-available sites
    * Often considerable effort has to be invested to create markup for useful resources
    * eg europarl corpus


* Why are DH resources interesting?
    * complexity
    * variety
    * existing markup
    * rich research questions

* Taking example of manuscript marked up with ENRICH
    * Create linguistic resource for training MT
    * IR
    * information extraction
    * parsing

Benefits

* structural challenges which RDF/RDFa approach addresses
 * mixing different markups cleanly
 * link knowledge and content and metadata
 * structured, unified query
 * federation and interlinking
 * syntactic aspects like stand-off markup

* Provenance

* Quality metrics
 * linguistic quality metrics

* 'get what I want'
 * advantage to this approach: sub-sample the full set of possible metadata

* Applications
    * Shared evaluation tasks
    * Development and improvement of nlp

* open issues:
 * no tei-rdf?
